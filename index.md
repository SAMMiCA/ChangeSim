## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/SAMMiCA/ChangeSim/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/SAMMiCA/ChangeSim/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.








# ChangeSim: Towards End-to-End Online Scene Change Detection inIndustrial Indoor Environments

## Abstract

We present a challenging dataset, ChangeSim, aimed at online scene change detection (SCD) and more. The data is collected in photo-realistic simulation environments with the presence of environmental non-targeted variations, such as air turbidity and light condition changes, as well as targeted object changes in industrial indoor environments. By collecting data in simulations, multi-modal sensor data and precise ground truth labels are obtainable such as the RGB image, depth image, semantic segmentation, change segmentation, camera poses, and 3D reconstructions. While the previous online SCD datasets evaluate models given well-aligned image pairs, ChangeSim also provides raw unpaired sequences that present an opportunity to develop an online SCD model in an end-to-end manner, considering both pairing and detection. Experiments show that even the latest pair-based SCD models suffer from the bottleneck of the pairing process, and it gets worse when the environment contains the non-targeted variations.
